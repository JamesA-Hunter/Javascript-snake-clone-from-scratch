# javascript-snake-clone-from-scratch
# project i did to learn javascript

I made this project from scratch without looking into any tutorials on how a game works
and thought it would be most effective to learn by creating it blind only looking up what
the syntax for what i was trying to do. it has many flaws ^^

# issues
- rendering the scene is very very unoptimized and could be improved
	by only redrawing the player instead of the entire grid

## to do
- add restart function
- calculate big o' cost of game logic()
- add styling to index.html
